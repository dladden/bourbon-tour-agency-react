    privacy_answer:
      "We take security very seriously, and we take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Shelby Bourbon Tours does not collect sensitive information such as credit card information. Wherever you provide sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted securely to Stripe's integrated financial services technology. Through integrated technologies like Stripe and Auth0, we protect and secure your sensitive information with modern security services. Stripe is a PCI Service Provider Level 1 that provides the highest market security level. At the same time, we utilize Auth0 for user authentication to protect the user and our business. Auth0 uses OAuth 2 as a standard protocol to implement authorization allowing users to grant limited access to their resources on one site. Additionally, you can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser or looking for 'https' at the beginning of the address of the web page. If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone via email at: developers@shlebybourbontours.com",
